Introduction</p><p id='bodyT'>This section discusses the weather and climate associated with cyclones and the anticyclones in the geographic extent of South Africa. The cyclones are characterized by low-pressure cells and the anticyclones by high-pressure cells. The low-pressure cells are associated with the rising of warm moist air, as the air rises it cools adiabatically resulting in wet weather conditions as compared to the high-pressure cells which are associated with dry weather conditions. <b>Figure 1</b> summarizes the air movement for cyclones. However, the next sub-sections will go in depth about the cyclones.The low-pressure cells that affect the South African weather and climate are:<br><br>(a) Mid-Latitude Cyclone,<br>(b) Tropical Cyclone, and<br>(c) The coastal Low.<br>The high-pressure cells affecting the South African weather and climate are:<br>(a) South Atlantic High-Pressure Cell (SAH),<br>(b) South Indian High-Pressure Cell (SIH),<br>(c) Kalahari High-Pressure Cell (KHPC).<br><img src='fig1_cyclones.jpg' width=324 height=251></img><br><b>Figure 1:</b> The vertical and horizontal air movement associated with cyclones and anticyclones.</p>",

Lesson Content</b></p><p id='headerT1'><b>3.1 Mid-Latitude Cyclones</b></p><p id='headerT1'><b>3.1.1 General Characteristics</b></p><p id='bodyT'><b>Mid-latitude cyclones</b> originate along a polar from where the warm moist air meets the cold dense air. The temperature contrast between these air masses creates a boundary, and the rotation of the Earth helps to generate the cyclonic or clockwise circulation. Mid-Latitude cyclones are a huge system with a radius ranging from a hundred to a thousand of kilometres. The centre of a tropical cyclone is characterized by a low pressure in the centre. When looked at a satellite image, the cloud appearance as shown in <b>Figure 2.</b><img src='mid_latitude_cyclone.jpg' width=546 height=392></img><br><b>Figure 2</b>: <i>Mid-Latitude cyclone striking Mossel Bay in the year 2013.</i><p id='bodyT'>The mid-latitude cyclone has fronts known as <b>cold front</b> and a <b>warm front</b>. The cold ¬front is formed behind the low-pressure centre and the warm front is formed ahead of the low-pressure centre. These two fronts are separated by a boundary known as frontal boundary. The two stages associated with the life cycle of a tropical cyclone are known as <b>cyclogenesis</b> and <b>cyclothesis</b>. The cyclogenesis refers to that stage of the formation of a mid-latitude cyclone while the cyclothesis refers to the mature stage up to the occlusion stage.</p><p id='bodyT'><br>The general movement of a mid-latitude cyclone is from west to east. This is because the mid-latitude cyclone is driven by the mid-latitude prevailing westerlies. See <b>Figure 3</b> for general wind movements. The <b>jet stream</b> and <b>polar front</b> influences the movement of mid-latitude cyclone. Because the mid-latitude cyclone is made up of different air masses (warm moist air and cold dense air), there are different weather conditions associated with mid-</p>",
    
    "teacher_notes11": "<p id='bodyT1'>latitude cyclone. Along the warm front there is a distributed and extended duration of precipitation, and along the cold front thunderstorms may occur. Unstable weather conditions are experienced in a region between the two fronts.<br><br><img src='westerlies.jpg' width=534 height=356></img><br><b>Figure 3:</b> <i>Wind movements across the globe.</i><br><br>Near the centre of a mid-latitude cyclone there is a forceful pressure gradient (the isobars are closer together) and the pressure gradient decreases away from the low-pressure centre. Conversely, high winds are experienced near the centre of a low-pressure cell. The temperature patters along large geographic areas are influenced by warm air northward and frigid air southward.</p><p id='headerT1'><b>3.1.2 Areas of formation</b></p><p id='bodyT'>Mid-Latitude cyclones do not only have impact in the South African weather, but it is a global phenomenon. Mid-latitude cyclones form between the 30° and 75° latitudes north and south of the equator. Typically, the earth is made up four pressure belts in both north and south of the equator. <b>Figure 4</b> shows these pressure belts. In <b>Figure 4</b> the pressure belts are highlighted in red, and the air circulation (also known as jet streams) are blue and red arrows. Jet streams can also be seen in <b>Figure 3</b>. The air from low-pressure belts rotates clockwise and the air from high pressure belts rotates anti-clockwise.</p><p id='bodyTT'>As the earth revolves the sun while rotating on its axis tilted at an angle of about 24.3° (see Figure 5), these pressure belts are not fixed such that they can shift by a latitude change of 5° in both north and south of the equator. The largest shift in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the sun is directly above the tropic of Cancer and tropic of Capricorn, respectively.

If there is an enough disturbance in the jet streams necessary for the formation of a mid-latitude cyclone, the cold air mass undercuts the warm air mass forcing it to rise thus creating a low-pressure cell at which the wind rotates clockwise. When this happens, the meteorologist refers to it as a cyclogenesis stage.</p><p id='headerT1'><br><b>3.1.4 Stages of development and related weather conditions</b></p><p id='bodyT'>In 3.1.1, the conditions necessary for the formation of mid-latitude cyclone were discussed. This subtopic is giving details about what happens after the cyclogenesis stage. Mid-latitude cyclone undergoes five distinct stages of development throughout its lifecycle (cyclogenesis stage to cyclothesis stage) as they are discussed in Figure 5 below, however, the open wave development falls outside this study.</p><p id='bodyT'><b>(a) The Initial Stage</b><br>The initial stage is the very first stage of development of a mid-latitude cyclone. In this stage, it means that the polar front has occurred due to the sufficient temperature differences of the two air masses.</p><p id='bodyT'><b>(b) The wave stage </b><br>This is the second stage of development of a mid-latitude cyclone.

Depending on where these storms form, they have different names in various parts of the world others call them tropical cyclones, some call them typhoons, and some call them hurricanes. These cyclones are often given names after the formation; thus, they are named alphabetically starting from A-Z. That is the first cyclone will be given a female name starting with, e.g. tropical cyclone Anna, the second one Beatrice, and the pattern continues like that.

Like the mid-latitude cyclones, tropical cyclones are also a low-pressure system. Tropical cyclones centre is known as the eye. The lowest pressure of the tropical cyclone is in the low pressure-centre (the eye). The eye of a tropical cyclone is characterized by clear skies. I addition to the eye, the tropical cyclone low-pressure centre also has what is known as the eyewall. The eyewall is known as the very destructive part of the tropical cyclone because this is where most of the rainfall occurs, and it is the windy part of the tropical cyclone. The spiral rainbands are also within the low-pressure centre. The spiral rainbands refer to the swirling bands of clouds filled with rain.</p>",
